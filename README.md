# Platformer
This is a platformer that I am creating for my software design class. It is my first milestone project.


With this project I am aiming to create a side scrolling platformer with sprites and some obsticles to avoid. I want there to be a scoring system. That system might be distance, enemys destroyed, or coins collected, I am not certain at this time.
